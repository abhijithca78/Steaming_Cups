# Steaming Cups

## Running the App Locally:
### Start the Metro server:

``` bash
npx react-native start
Run the app on Android:
```

``` bash
npx react-native run-android
```

This will build the app and deploy it to the connected Android emulator or device.


## Debugging and Development:
- Debugging:

Utilize tools like React DevTools, Chrome DevTools, or integrated debugging tools in editors like VSCode.

- Hot Reloading:

Changes to your code will be reflected in real-time without requiring a full app restart.
Building and Deploying:
Generate a release build:

```bash
npx react-native run-android --variant=release
```
This will create a release build of your app.

## Handling Dependencies:

Use npm or yarn to manage your project dependencies.
